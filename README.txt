## Project Details
**Project Name:** Student Attendance Management System

**Aim:** The aim of this project is to develop a Student Attendance Management System that records, displays, and counts the attendance of students using a simple array-based approach.

**Topic Name:**
- 1D Arrays for storing attendance data
- Loops for traversing student records
- Conditional statements (if–else) for attendance logic
- Functions for modular program structure

**Tech Stack:**
- Programming Language: C
- Tools: VS Code, GCC Compiler

**Expected Outcome:**
- Ability to store and process attendance data using arrays
- Understanding of array indexing and iteration
- Improved logic building with conditions and loops

**Detailed Walkthrough:**
1. Declare a 1D integer array where each index represents a student.
2. Decide that 0 represents Absent and 1 represents Present.
3. Use a loop to go through each student and mark attendance.
4. Take input for each student’s attendance using scanf and store in the array.
5. Use another loop to display the attendance of all students.
6. Initialize counters for present and absent students.
7. Use a loop to check each element in the array.
8. If the element is 1, increment the present counter.
9. If the element is 0, increment the absent counter.
10. Print the total number of present and absent students.

## Why I Made the Project
This project was created to gain hands-on experience with fundamental programming concepts in C, such as arrays, loops, and functions. It also helps in understanding how to build a simple, real-world application that can be expanded in the future.

## Utility
The Student Attendance Management System provides a basic yet effective way to record and analyze student attendance. It can be used in small classrooms or as a learning tool for beginners to understand data handling and logic building in C.

## Future Scope
- Add features for storing student names and IDs.
- Implement file handling to save and retrieve attendance records.
- Create a user-friendly interface for easier interaction.
- Expand the system to handle multiple classes or subjects.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice using arrays, loops, and conditional statements in C.
- Develop modular code using functions.
- Improve problem-solving and logic-building skills.

## What I Learned
By making this project, I learned how programming languages like C can be used to solve real-world problems. I practiced using arrays and loops to manage data, and understood how to break down a problem into smaller steps. This project gave me confidence to build more programs in the future.

## Conclusion
This project helped reinforce core programming concepts and provided practical experience in building a simple management system using C. It lays the foundation for more advanced projects in the future.
